Team Project - WeatherApp (2025)

This project is a team-built weather application created together with my friend Marius, who implemented the Python backend while I developed the entire frontend using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

It is the first project I have ever built based on a complete **Figma** template, which helped me understand UI structure, spacing, color systems, and component mapping from design to code.

It was also the first time I used **Slack** and **Trello** for real workflow communication and task management. These tools helped us stay organized, discuss API changes efficiently, and simulate a real development process similar to what teams use in production.

The website contains the following pages with fully responsive layouts:

- Home page
- Weather forecast page
- News page
- About page

Can be found at https://teamproject-weatherapp.vercel.app

Technologies used: Next.js, Python, Tailwind CSS, Typescript, Figma, Slack, Trello.
